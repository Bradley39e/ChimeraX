<h1>UCSF ChimeraX Prerelease</h1>

<p>
UCSF ChimeraX is the next-generation visualization program from the Computer Graphics Lab at UC San Francisco,
following Midas, MidasPlus, and Chimera.
</p>

<p>
Compared to Chimera,
ChimeraX has better graphics (e.g. interactive ambient shadows), handles
large structures (millions of atoms) much faster, and has a modern 
single-window user interface
(see <a href="http://preview.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/user/advantages.html">short list of advantages</a>).
However, ChimeraX currently has a <span style="color:red;">very limited set of features</span> 
compared to the production
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/">Chimera</a>. 
It has almost no user interface dialogs, no structure alignment, 
no sequence tools, no trajectory playback,
no distance measurements, no hydrogen-bond or clash detection, <i>etc.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span style="color:red;">
Warning: ChimeraX is not backward compatible with Chimera,
and the command syntax is subject to change.
