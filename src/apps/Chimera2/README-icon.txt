Chimera-icon.ai is the original Chimera icon designed by Heidi Houtkooper.
It was touched up Jessen Bredeson with drop shadows and contributed
back via the chimera-users mailing list.

Chimera2-icon.svg started with the original Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file,
then added a 2 from the Mallige font, converted the '2' to a path, and
added drop shadows.
