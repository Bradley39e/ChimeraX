Chimera-icon.ai is the original Chimera icon designed by Heidi Houtkooper.
It was touched up Jessen Bredeson with drop shadows and contributed
back via the chimera-users mailing list.

ChimeraX-icon.svg started with Heidi's original Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file,
then added a X from the URW Chancery L font, converted the 'X' to a path, and
added drop shadows.

For some reason, in inkscape, the Chimera icon and the character drop their shadows in oposite directions, so for one the parameters are:

	Blur radius (px): 4.7
	Horizontal offset(px): 8.0
	Vertical offset(px): 8.0
	Shadow type: Outer

and for the other, the vertical offset is -8.0.
