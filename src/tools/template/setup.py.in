        # Each tool should have a single line with the following fields:
        #
        # 'ChimeraX-Bundle' :: tool_name :: module_name
        # :: display_name :: commands :: categories
        # :: file_types :: session_versions :: custom_init
        # :: synopsis
        #
        # 'tool_name', 'module_name' and 'display_name' are strings.
        # 'commands' and 'categories' are comma separated strings.
        # Note that TOOL_PKG_NAME does not need to match the install
        # package name; in particular, it may be a subpackage.
        # TOOL_DISPLAY_NAME is distinct from PKG_DESCRIPTION because
        # a single package may provide multiple tools.
        # 'file_types' is a comma-separated list of colon-separated
        # strings.  The file_types arguments are used directly as
        # arguments to chimerax.core.io.register.
        # 'session_versions' is a comma-separated two-tuple of
        # integers, representing the minimum and maximum session
        # versions that this tool can read.
        # 'custom_init' is a string.  If not set to 'true', the tool
        # package is not imported until actually invoked.  If set to
        # 'true', the 'initialize' method is always called on start up.
        # 'synopsis' is a short description of the tool.  It is here
        # because it needs to be part of the metadata available for
        # uninstalled tools, so that users can get more than just a
        # name for deciding whether they want the tool or not.
