        # 'ChimeraX-Bundle' :: tool_name :: module_name

        # :: synopsis

        # 'tool_name', 'module_name' and 'display_name' are strings.
        # 'commands' and 'categories' are comma separated strings.
        # Note that TOOL_PKG_NAME does not need to match the install
        # package name; in particular, it may be a subpackage.
        # TOOL_DISPLAY_NAME is distinct from PKG_DESCRIPTION because
        # a single package may provide multiple tools.
        # 'synopsis' is a short description of the tool.  It is here
        # because it needs to be part of the metadata available for
        # uninstalled tools, so that users can get more than just a
        # name for deciding whether they want the tool or not.
        #
        # Example:
        # "ChimeraX-Bundle :: cmd_line :: chimerax.cmd_line "
        # ":: Command Line Interface :: command_line :: General"
        "ChimeraX-Bundle :: TOOL_NAME :: TOOL_PKG_NAME "
