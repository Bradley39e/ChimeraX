    <h2>Send to Quest</h2>
    <p>
      This tool sends a scene to an Oculus Quest VR headset to be viewed
      by the LookSee application.  See
      <a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/data/looksee-mar2023/looksee.html">instructions</a>
      for how to install LookSee on a Quest 2 or Quest Pro headset.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scene must be simple enough for the Quest 2 or Quest Pro graphics to handle without
      flickering.  If the room is shown (with pass-through video) the scene should
      have less than 700000 million triangles and with room not shown (black background)
      less than 900000 triangles.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the LookSee app clicking the A or X hand-controller button
      will show the user interface, and clicking "Open new files" will make new
      files sent from ChimeraX automatically display.  There may be up to a 5
      second delay displaying a new file.
    </p>

    <h3>Setup</h3>

    <p>
      To send the scene the computer must have the adb (Android Debug Bridge)
      command line program installed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scene shown in ChimeraX can be sent wirelessly or over a USB cable
      connecting the computer to the VR headset.  To set up wireless transfer
      follow these steps
