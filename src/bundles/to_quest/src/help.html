    <h2>Send to Quest</h2>
    <p>
      This tool sends a scene to an Oculus VR headset to be viewed by the Lookie
      or LookieAR (augmented reality) application.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scene must be simple enough for the Quest graphics to handle without
      flickering.  With Lookie it must have less than 1 million triangles and
      with LookieAR (which also shows the room), less than 300,000 triangles.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Lookie and LookieAR apps clicking the A or X hand-controller button
      will show the user interface, and clicking "Open new files" will make new
      files sent from ChimeraX automatically display.  There may be up to a 5
      second delay displaying a new file.
    </p>

    <h3>Setup</h3>

    <p>
      To send the scene the computer must have the adb (Android Debug Bridge)
      command line program installed.
    </p>

      The scene shown in ChimeraX can be sent wirelessly or over a USB cable
      connecting the computer to the VR headset.  To set up wireless transfer
