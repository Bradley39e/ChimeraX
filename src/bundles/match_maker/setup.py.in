description = """
MatchMaker superimposes protein or nucleic acid structures by first creating pairwise sequence alignments, then fitting the aligned residue pairs. Residue types and/or secondary structure information can be used to create the initial sequence alignments. Fitting uses one point per residue. Optionally, a structure-based multiple sequence alignment can be computed after the structures have been superimposed.
