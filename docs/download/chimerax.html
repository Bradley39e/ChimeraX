<h1>UCSF ChimeraX Prerelease</h1>

<p>November 11, 2015</p>

<p>
UCSF ChimeraX is the next-generation visualization program from the Computer Graphics Lab at UC San Francisco,
following Midas, MidasPlus, and Chimera.
</p>

<h2>
Features
</h2>

<p>
ChimeraX has better graphics (<i>e.g.</i> interactive ambient shadows), handles large structures (millions of atoms)
much faster, has a modern single-window user interface, and will have a website describing available extensions
written by others using documented programming interfaces.
</p>

<h2>
Compatibility
</h2>

<p>
ChimeraX is not backward compatible with Chimera, although many aspects will be familiar from Chimera.

development source code. Thus the software will change from day to day,
and while a given build may have unforeseen problems, these are often
fixed by the next day.

<h2>
Linux Notes
</h2>
<p>
The Linux download will not work on Linux distributions besides Debian 8 because of
many missing system libraries.  It is possible to install all the needed libraries.
We have used it on Ubuntu 15.04 after installing a handful of missing libraries.
