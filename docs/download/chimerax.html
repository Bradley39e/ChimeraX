<h1>UCSF ChimeraX Prerelease</h1>

<p>October 14, 2016</p>

<p>
UCSF ChimeraX is the next-generation visualization program from the 
Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics
at UC San Francisco, following Midas, MidasPlus, and Chimera.
</p>

<h2>
Features
</h2>

<p>
Compared to Chimera,
ChimeraX has better graphics (e.g. interactive ambient shadows), handles
large structures (millions of atoms) much faster, and has a modern 
single-window user interface
(see <a href="../user/advantages.html">short list of advantages</a>).
ChimeraX will have a web site of available extensions written by others 
using documented programming interfaces.  Here are illustrations of some
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/adcom16/chimerax.html">ChimeraX features from 2016</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/adcom15/chimera2.html">from 2015</a>.
</p>

<h2>
Missing Features
</h2>

<p>
ChimeraX currently has a <font color=red>limited set of features</font> 
compared to <a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/">Chimera</a>. 
It has very few user-interface dialogs; most features are implemented
as commands only (see the <a href="../user/index.html">User Guide</a>).
It lacks distance measurements, hydrogen-bond detection, 
3D labels, sequence display, saving PDB files, 
support for docking and trajectory formats, <i>etc.</i>
We will be adding these in the future.
</p>

<h2>
Compatibility
</h2>

<p>
ChimeraX is not backward compatible with Chimera, although many aspects will be familiar from Chimera.
</p>

Prerelease Downloads

<p>
Warnings: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>ChimeraX is not yet released and the command syntax is subject to change.
<li>Sessions saved with prerelease versions of ChimeraX are 
only guaranteed to be restorable using the same version
and may not be compatible with future versions.

Daily builds are generated automatically each night from the 
development source code. Thus the software will change from day to day,
and while a given build may have unforeseen problems, these are often
fixed by the next day.

<h2>
Linux Notes
</h2>
<p>
The Linux download will not work on Linux distributions besides Debian 8 because of
many missing system libraries.  It is possible to install all the needed libraries.
We have used it on Ubuntu 15.04 after installing a handful of missing libraries.
