<h1>UCSF ChimeraX Prerelease</h1>

<p>November 25, 2015</p>

<p>
UCSF ChimeraX is the next-generation visualization program from the 
Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics
at UC San Francisco, following Midas, MidasPlus, and Chimera.
</p>

<h2>
Features
</h2>

<p>
Compared to Chimera,
ChimeraX has better graphics (e.g. interactive ambient shadows), handles
large structures (millions of atoms) much faster, and has a modern 
single-window user interface
(see <a href="../user/advantages.html">short list of advantages</a>).
ChimeraX will have a web site of available extensions written by others 
using documented programming interfaces.
</p>

<h2>
Missing Features
</h2>

<p>
ChimeraX currently has a <font color=red>limited set of features</font> 
compared to the production
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/">Chimera</a>. 
It has almost no user-interface dialogs, no structure alignment, 
no sequence tools, no trajectory playback,
no distance measurements, no hydrogen-bond or clash detection, <i>etc.</i>
We will be adding these in the future.
</p>

<h2>
Compatibility
</h2>

<p>
ChimeraX is not backward compatible with Chimera, although many aspects will be familiar from Chimera.
</p>

Daily builds are generated automatically each night from the 
development source code. Thus the software will change from day to day,
and while a given build may have unforeseen problems, these are often
fixed by the next day.

<h2>
Linux Notes
</h2>
<p>
The Linux download will not work on Linux distributions besides Debian 8 because of
many missing system libraries.  It is possible to install all the needed libraries.
We have used it on Ubuntu 15.04 after installing a handful of missing libraries.
