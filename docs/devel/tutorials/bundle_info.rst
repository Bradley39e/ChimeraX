Bundle Information XML Tags
===========================

ChimeraX bundle information is stored in **bundle_info.xml**.
XML elements in the file typically have *attributes* and either
(a) *child elements*, or (b) *element text*.
An attributes is used for a value that may be represented
as a simple string, such as an identifiers or a version numbers.
The element text is used for a more complex value, such as a
file name which may contain spaces.
Child elements are used for multi-valued data, such as a
list of file names, one element per value.

The supported elements are listed below in alphabetical order.
The root document elements is **BundleInfo**, which contains
all the information needed to build the bundle.

NB: All elements except **BundleInfo** may have a **platform**
attribute.  If the **platform** attribute *is* present and its
value does *not* matches the build platform, then the element and
all its children are ignored.  Supported values for **platform**
are: ``mac``, ``windows``, and ``linux``.  An example use for the
**platform** attribute is in supporting the Space Navigator device.
On macOS, ChimeraX relies on a compiled C module, while on Windows
and Linux, it uses pure Python with the ``ctypes`` module;
in this case, the **CModule** element has a **platform** attribute
of ``mac``.

.. _ChimeraX Metadata Classifiers:

ChimeraX Metadata Classifiers
-----------------------------

ChimeraX gathers metadata from Python-wheel-style classifiers
listed in the bundle.  The only required classifier is
for overall bundle metadata; additional classifiers provide
information about tools (graphical interfaces), commands,
data formats, and selectors.

*Bundle Metadata*

    ``ChimeraX`` :: ``Bundle`` :: *categories* :: *session_versions* :: *api_module_name* :: *supercedes* :: *custom_init*

    - *categories* is a comma separated list of category names.
      (Category names are the names that appear under the ``Tools``
      menu.)
      This value is currently unused but are intended for constructing
      "toolboxes" in the future.
    - *session_versions* is a comma-separated two-tuple of
      integers, representing the minimum and maximum session
      versions that this tool can read.
    - *api_module_name* is a string with the name of the module that
      has the bundle_api in it.
    - *supercedes* is an optional comma separated list of names that
      under which the bundle was previously released.
    - *custom_init* is a string.  If not set to ``true``, the
      bundle is not imported until actually invoked.  If set to
      ``true``, the ``bundle_api.initialize`` method for the bundle
      is called after the main session has been created.

    For example::

      ChimeraX :: Bundle :: Volume data :: 1,1 ::

    This classifier is automatically generated when using the ``devel``
    command and **bundle_info.xml**.


*Tool Metadata*

    ``ChimeraX`` :: ``Tool`` :: *tool_name* :: *categories* :: *synopsis*

    - *tool_name* is a string that uniquely identifies the tool.
    - *categories* is a comma separated list of category names under
      which the tool will appear.
    - *synopsis* is a short description of the tool.  It is here for
      uninstalled tools, so that users can get more than just a
      name for deciding whether they want the tool or not.

    For example::

      ChimeraX :: Tool :: Help Viewer :: General :: Show help

    Notes:

    - Tool instances are created via the ``bundle_api.start_tool`` method.
    - Bundles may provide more than one tool.

*Command Metadata*

    ``ChimeraX`` :: ``Command`` :: *name* :: *categories* :: *synopsis*

    - *name* is a string and may have spaces in it.
    - *categories* should be a subset of the bundle's categories. 
    - *synopsis* is a short description of the command.  It is here for
      uninstalled commands, so that users can get more than just a
      name for deciding whether they want the command or not.

    For example::

      ChimeraX :: Command :: exit :: General :: terminate ChimeraX

    Notes:

    - Commands are lazily registered, so the argument specification
      isn't needed until the command is first used.
    - Command registration is done via the
      ``bundle_api.register_command`` method.
    - Bundles may provide more than one command.


*Data Format Metadata*

    ``ChimeraX`` :: ``DataFormat`` :: *format_name* :: *nicknames* :: *category* :: *suffixes* :: *mime_types* :: *url* :: *dangerous* :: *icon* :: *synopsis* :: *encoding*

    - *format_name* is a string.
    - *nicknames* is an optional comma-separated list of strings.
      If no nickname is given, it defaults to the lowercased format_name.
    - *category* is a toolshed category.
    - *suffixes* is an optional comma-separated list of strings with
      leading periods, i.e., ``.pdb``.
    - *mime_types* is an optinal comma-separated list of strings, e.g.,
      chemical/x-pdb.
    - *url* is a string that has a URL that points to the data format's docmentation.
    - *dangerous* is an optional boolean and should be ``true`` if the data
      format is insecure -- defaults to true if a script.
    - *icon* is an optional string containing the filename of the icon --
      it defaults to the default icon for the category.
    - *synopsis* is a short description of the data format.  It is here
      because it needs to be part of the metadata available for
      uninstalled data format, so that users can get more than just a
      name for deciding whether they want the data format or not.
    - *encoding* should be given for text formats and is the file encoding.

    For example::

      ChimeraX :: DataFormat :: PDB :: :: Molecular Structure :: .pdb, .ent :: chemical/x-pdb :: http://www.pdb.org/ :: :: :: Protein DataBank file
      ChimeraX :: DataFormat :: mmCIF :: :: Molecular Structure :: .mmcif, .cif :: chemical/x-mmcif :: http://www.pdb.org/ :: :: :: MacroMolecular CIF

    In addition to describing the format, the bundle should say how if it
    can fetch, open or save data in that format.

        ``ChimeraX`` :: ``Open`` :: *format_name* :: *tag* :: *is_default* :: *extra_keywords*

        ``ChimeraX`` :: ``Save`` :: *format_name* :: *tag* :: *is_default* :: *extra_keywords*

        ``ChimeraX`` :: ``Fetch`` :: *database_name* :: *format_name* :: *prefixes* :: *example_id* :: *is_default*

    - *format_name* is a format previously given in a ChimeraX :: DataFormat
      line.
    - *prefixes* is a comma-separated list of strings associated with the
      (database_name, format_name).
    - *tag* is a string is disambiguate multiple readers or writers.
    - *is_default* is a string.  If set to ``true``, this format is
      the default format for the database.
    - *extra_keywords* is an optional comma-separated list of additional
      keyword arguments.  The keyword can be followed by a colon and a
      ChimeraX argument type without the Arg suffix.  If the argument type
      isn't found in the :py:class:`chimerax.core.commands` module, the bundle API class is
      searched for it.
    - *database_name* is a string with the name of the databasea to fetch
      the data from.
    - *example_id* is a string with an example identifier.

    For example::
    
      ChimeraX :: Open :: PDB :: PDB ::
      ChimeraX :: Save :: PDB :: PDB ::
      ChimeraX :: Fetch :: PDB :: mmcif :: pdb :: 1a0m ::
      ChimeraX :: Fetch :: PDB :: PDB :: :: 1a0m ::

    Notes:

    - File operations are performed via the ``bundle_api.open_file``,
      ``bundle_api.save_file``, and
      ``bundle_api.fetch_from_database`` methods.
    - The data format metadata is used to generate the macOS
      application property list.
    - Bundles may provide more than one data format.


*Selector Metadata*

    ``ChimeraX`` :: ``Selector`` :: *name* :: *synopsis*

    - *name* is a string and may have spaces in it.
    - *synopsis* is a short description of the selector.  It is here for
      uninstalled selectors, so that users can get more than just a
      name for deciding whether they want the selector or not.

    For example::
    
      ChimeraX :: Selector :: helix :: Helical regions in proteins

    Notes:

    - Bundles may provide more than one selector.
    - Many commands take optional keywords before atom and object
      specifiers.  If a selector name is the same as the optional
      keyword, the command will interpret it as the keyword rather
      than the selector.  The bottom line is "choose your selector
      names carefully."
