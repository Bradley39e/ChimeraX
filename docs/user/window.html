<h2>The ChimeraX Window</h2>
<a href="crispr.png">
<img class="outlineCR" width="450px" src="crispr.png" 
alt="ChimeraX window" title="click to enlarge..."></a>
<p>
ChimeraX has an all-in-one window interface in which various
<b><i>panels</i></b> can be shown, hidden, and repositioned. 
Panels can also be detached (undocked) from the main ChimeraX window 
and subsequently reinserted (docked).
The overall window also contains the <b><i>main window</i></b>
for 3D graphics, a <b><i>title bar</i></b> across the top, 
and a <b><i>status line</i></b> for transient messages across the bottom. 
At the bottom right are small icons:
<ul>
<li><img class="iconbar" src="toggle.png"> 
- toggle main window to fill overall window
<li><img class="iconbar" src="rapidoff.png">
or <img class="iconbar" src="rapidon.png"> 
- toggle main window between 3D graphics and <b>Rapid Access</b> 
<br>(see <a href="tools/filehistory.html"><b>File History</b></a>)
</ul>
<p>

<a href="commands/mousemode.html"><b>mousemode</b></a>
</p><p>
A panel may include clickable icons (as in the
<a href="tools/graphics.html"><b>Graphics Toolbar</b></a>),
interactive 2D representations such as histograms and network diagrams,
or HTML with links and images
(as in the <a href="tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>
and <a href="#browser"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>).
</p><p>
Panels are often <a href="index.html#tools">tool</a>
interfaces, but may also appear as the result of a
<a href="index.html#commands">command</a> 
(for example, <a href="commands/contacts.html"><b>contacts</b></a>
or <a href="commands/help.html"><b>help</b></a>).
</p><p>
<a name="toolstart"></a>
A tool can be shown by using the <b>Tools</b> menu or
<b>toolshed</b> command, or by <a href="commands/open.html">opening</a>
a certain type of data. For example, opening a density map starts 
<a href="tools/volumeviewer.html"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>.
<!-- start/show will be migrated to ui command instead -->
A tool can be designated to &ldquo;autostart&rdquo; when ChimeraX is started,
using the <b>ui</b> command or the context menu from right-clicking*
within the tool panel.
</p><p>
<a name="mac-context"></a>
<font size="+2"><b>*</b></font>for Mac touchpad or single-button mouse,
Ctrl-click replaces &ldquo;right-click&rdquo; for showing context menus
</p><p>
<a name="panelcontrol"></a>
A panel can also be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>dismissed by clicking the &ldquo;x&rdquo; button <img src="x.png">
on its title bar (if the panel is docked; a generic close-window button 
if the panel is undocked) or by unchecking its name in the context menu 
from right-clicking* any docked panel's title bar
<li>shown (if active but hidden) by checking its name in
the context menu from right-clicking* any docked panel's title bar;
some panels remain active when dismissed, others do not
<li>undocked from the main ChimeraX window
by clicking the &ldquo;rectangles&rdquo; button <img src="undock.png">
on its title bar or by dragging or double-clicking its title bar
<li>redocked by dragging or double-clicking its title bar, with the
dragged location controlling where and how the panel will be inserted
<li>tabbed with other panels, with only one shown at a time.
Tabs are shown at the bottom of the panel.
A tabbed set of panels can be docked/undocked collectively by dragging
its top bar, and an individual tabbed panel can be untabbed 
(separated from the others) by dragging its tab.
</ul>
<p>
<a href="index.html#tools">Icon toolbars</a>
and the <a href="tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line</b></a>
lack their own title bars, but the other methods of control
are still available.
The overall window or any undocked panel can be resized by dragging 
any corner and moved by dragging its title bar.
The boundaries between docked panels or between panel(s) and the
main window can be dragged to expand one side and shrink the other
while keeping the overall window dimensions the same.
Finally, the overall window can be toggled to hide/show the current panels 
by clicking the &ldquo;nested squares&rdquo; button
<img width="20px" src="toggle.png"> near its bottom right corner.
This allows expanding the main window with a single click
without losing the overall window configuration.
Icon toolbars and the <a href="tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line</b></a>
are excluded from this toggling.
</p><p>
Panel contents (away from the title bar) may have their own specific context menus.

<h3>ChimeraX Browser and Help Viewer</h3>
<p>
The <b>Help Viewer</b> is a built-in HTML browser. 
ChimeraX help pages are written in HTML and can be shown in the 
<b>Help Viewer</b> by using the <b>Help</b> menu, the
<a href="commands/help.html"><b>help</b></a> command, tool context menus,
and/or links in the <a href="tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
The <b>Help Viewer</b> opens as a separate window, but can be
docked to and undocked from the main window like other panels,
as described <a href="#panelcontrol">above</a>.
The name listed for the <b>Help Viewer</b> in panel title-bar menus
will be the title of the HTML page it is showing.
Buttons and context menus are provided for navigation
(back, forward, reload) and adjusting the font size, 
and there is a field for entering search text.
</p><p>
An important advantage of the built-in browser is that it provides a simple
mechanism to execute ChimeraX commands by clicking special links, for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="cxcmd:open 1gcn"><b>open 1gcn</b></a>
<br> &ndash; encoded as &ndash; <br>
<b>&lt;a href="cxcmd:open 1gcn"&gt;open 1gcn&lt;/a&gt;</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
** The execution links will only work in the ChimeraX browser, however,
not other web browsers.**
</p><p>
With this mechanism, it is easy to create web pages that use ChimeraX for
structure display and other features, as in a scientific presentation or
ChimeraX tutorial. 
The <a href="../quickstart/index.html">Quick Start Guide</a> includes
many more examples, as well as some javascript 
to display a brief explanation if such a link is clicked when the page 
is being viewed in some other browser. 
This javascript can be copied from the page source and used in other pages
with the special links, as desired.
</p><p>
Web content and HTML files in general
(with or without the special command-execution links)
can be shown in the ChimeraX browser with commands:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b><a href="commands/open.html">open</a> &nbsp;<i>URL</i></b>
<br>&ndash; or &ndash;<br>
<b><a href="commands/open.html">open</a> &nbsp;<i>local-file.html</i></b>
</blockquote>
Local files can also be opened with <b>File... Open</b> in the menu.
