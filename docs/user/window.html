<h2>The ChimeraX Window</h2>
<a href="crispr.png">

<p>
ChimeraX has an all-in-one window interface in which various
<b><i>panels</i></b> can be shown, hidden, and repositioned. 
Panels can also be detached (undocked) from the main ChimeraX window 
and subsequently reinserted (docked).
The overall window also contains the <b><i>main window</i></b>
for 3D graphics, a <b><i>title bar</i></b> across the top, 
and a <b><i>status line</i></b> for transient messages across the bottom. 
At the bottom right are small icons:
<ul>
<li><img class="iconbar" src="toggle.png"> 
- toggle main window to fill overall window
<li><img class="iconbar" src="rapidoff.png">
or <img class="iconbar" src="rapidon.png"> 
- toggle main window between 3D graphics and <b>Rapid Access</b> 
<br>(see <a href="tools/filehistory.html"><b>File History</b></a>)
</ul>

<h3>ChimeraX Panels and Context Menus</h3>
<p>
A <b><i>panel</i></b> may appear within the <a href="#top">ChimeraX window</a>
when a tool is started (for example, from the <b>Tools</b> menu),
or as the result of a calculation
(for example, the <a href="commands/interfaces.html"><b>interfaces</b></a> command
shows a chain-chain network diagram) or <a href="commands/open.html">opening</a>
a certain type of data (for example, opening a density map starts 
<a href="tools/volumeviewer.html"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>).
<!-- start/show will be migrated to ui command instead of toolshed -->
Panels may include clickable icons, interactive 2D representations 
like network diagrams, and (rendered) HTML with links and images, as in the 
<a href="tools/browser.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>.
</p><p>
A <b><i>context menu</i></b> is raised by right-clicking* parts of the interface.
</p><p>
<a name="mac-context"></a>
<font size="+2"><b>*</b></font>for Mac touchpad or single-button mouse,
Ctrl-click replaces &ldquo;right-click&rdquo; for showing context menus
</p><p>
A panel can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>dismissed by clicking the &ldquo;x&rdquo; button <img src="x.png">
on its title bar (if the panel is docked; a generic close-window button 
if the panel is undocked) or by unchecking its name in the context menu 
from right-clicking* any docked panel's title bar
<li>shown (if active but hidden) by checking its name in
the context menu from right-clicking* any docked panel's title bar;
some panels remain active when dismissed, others do not
<li>undocked from the main ChimeraX window
by clicking the &ldquo;rectangles&rdquo; button <img src="undock.png">
on its title bar or by dragging or double-clicking its title bar
<li>if <a href="#toolprefs">dockable</a>,
redocked by dragging or double-clicking its title bar, with the
dragged location controlling where and how the panel will be inserted
<li>tabbed with other panels, with only one shown at a time.
Tabs are shown at the bottom of the panel.
A tabbed set of panels can be docked/undocked collectively by dragging
its top bar, and an individual tabbed panel can be untabbed 
(separated from the others) by dragging its tab.
</ul>
<p>
<a href="index.html#tools">Icon toolbars</a>
and the <a href="tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line</b></a>
lack their own title bars, but the other methods of control
are still available.
The overall window or any undocked panel can be resized by dragging 
any corner and moved by dragging its title bar.
The boundaries between docked panels or between panel(s) and the
main window can be dragged to expand one side and shrink the other
while keeping the overall window dimensions the same.
Finally, the overall window can be toggled to hide/show the current panels 
by clicking the &ldquo;nested squares&rdquo; button
<img width="20px" src="toggle.png"> near its bottom right corner.
This allows expanding the main window with a single click
without losing the overall window configuration.
Icon toolbars and the <a href="tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line</b></a>
are excluded from this toggling.
</p><p>
<a name="toolprefs"></a>
Panels may have their own specific <a href="#panels">context menus</a>
(away from the title-bar area), typically including:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hide tool</b>
<li><b>Help</b>
- show documentation in the <a href="tools/browser.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>
<li>(if applicable) <b>Start at ChimeraX startup</b>
- whether the tool should start automatically upon subsequent ChimeraX startup;
saved in <a href="preferences.html#other">preferences</a>
<li>(if applicable) <b>Dockable tool</b>
- whether panels of the tool should be allowed to reinsert automatically
when dragged over the main window, as opposed to remaining separate;
initially true for all panels except the
<a href="tools/browser.html"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>;
saved in <a href="preferences.html#other">preferences</a>
</ul>
<p>
The latter two settings can be also be adjusted with the <b>ui</b> command.
