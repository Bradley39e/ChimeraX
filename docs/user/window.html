<h3>ChimeraX Window</h3>
<a href="crispr.png">

<p>
ChimeraX has an all-in-one window interface in which 
<b><i>panels</i></b> can be shown, hidden, and repositioned. 
The overall window also contains the <b><i>graphics</i></b> area, 
a <b><i>title bar</i></b> across the top, 
and a <b><i>status line</i></b> across the bottom.
</p><p>
A panel may include clickable icons (as in the
<a href="tools/graphics.html"><b>Graphics Toolbar</b></a>),
tables, plots, histograms, and other 2D representations with 
interactive elements, or HTML with links and images
(as in the <a href="tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>).
Panels are generally <a href="index.html#tools">tool</a>
interfaces, but may also appear as the result of a
<a href="index.html#commands">command</a> 
(for example, <b>contacts</b>).
Tools can be called from the <b>Tools</b> menu or with the
<b>toolshed</b> command.
See also:
<a href="commands/windowsize.html"><b>windowsize</b></a>
</p><p>
A panel can also be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>hidden by clicking the &ldquo;x&rdquo; button <img src="x.png">
on its title bar or by unchecking 
its name in the menu resulting from right-clicking any panel title bar
<li>shown (if started but hidden) by checking its name in
the menu resulting from right-clicking any panel title bar
<li>undocked so that it is separate from the main ChimeraX window
by clicking the &ldquo;rectangles&rdquo; button <img src="undock.png">
on its title bar or by dragging or double-clicking its title bar
<li>redocked by dragging or double-clicking its title bar, with the
dragged location controlling where and how the panel will be inserted;
multiple panels can be tabbed with each other so that they occupy 
the same space in the window, with only one shown at a time
</ul>
<p>
Icon toolbars and the <a href="tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line</b></a>
lack their own title bars, but the other methods of control
are still available.
The overall window or any undocked panel can be resized by dragging 
any corner and moved by dragging its title bar.
The boundaries between docked panels or between panel(s) and the
graphics area can be dragged to expand one side and shrink the other
while keeping the overall window dimensions the same.
Finally, the overall window can be toggled to hide/show the current panels 
by clicking the &ldquo;nested squares&rdquo; button
<img width="20px" src="toggle.png"> near its bottom right corner.
This allows giving more room to the graphics display in a single click
without losing the overall window configuration.
Icon toolbars and the <a href="tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line</b></a>
are excluded from this toggling.
</p><p>
ChimeraX's built-in HTML browser is automatically used to show 
help pages. It also provides a simple mechanism to execute ChimeraX commands 
by clicking links, as in the
<a href="../quickstart/index.html">Quick Start Guide</a>;
users can create their own HTML files, with or without such special links,
and open them in ChimeraX with the 
<a href="commands/help.html"><b>help</b></a> command.
