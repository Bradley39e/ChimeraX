<h3>ChimeraX Window</h3>
<a href="crispr.png">
<img class="outlineCR" width="450px" src="crispr.png" 
alt="ChimeraX window" title="click for larger..."></a>
<p>
ChimeraX has an all-in-one window interface in which 
<b><i>panels</i></b> can be shown, hidden, and repositioned. 
Panels can also be detached (undocked) from the main ChimeraX window 
and subsequently reinserted (docked).
The overall window also contains the <b><i>graphics</i></b> area, 
a <b><i>title bar</i></b> across the top, 
and a <b><i>status line</i></b> across the bottom.
See also:
<a href="commands/windowsize.html"><b>windowsize</b></a>
</p><p>
A panel may include clickable icons (as in the
<a href="tools/graphics.html"><b>Graphics Toolbar</b></a>),
tables, plots, histograms, and other 2D representations with 
interactive elements, or HTML with links and images
(as in the <a href="tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>
and <a href="#browser"><b>Help Viewer</b></a>).
</p><p>
Panels are often <a href="index.html#tools">tool</a>
interfaces, but may also appear as the result of a
<a href="index.html#commands">command</a> 
(for example, <b>contacts</b> or <a href="commands/help.html"><b>help</b></a>)
or opening a certain type of data.
A tool can be started or shown using the <b>Tools</b> menu and/or the
<b>toolshed</b> command.
</p><p>
<a name="panelcontrol"></a>
A panel can also be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>hidden by clicking the &ldquo;x&rdquo; button <img src="x.png">
on its title bar (if the panel is docked)
or by unchecking its name in the menu 
resulting from right-clicking any docked panel's title bar
<li>shown (if active but hidden) by checking its name in
the menu resulting from right-clicking any docked panel's title bar;
some tools remain active when hidden, others do not
<li>undocked from the main ChimeraX window
by clicking the &ldquo;rectangles&rdquo; button <img src="undock.png">
on its title bar or by dragging or double-clicking its title bar
<li>redocked by dragging or double-clicking its title bar, with the
dragged location controlling where and how the panel will be inserted;
multiple panels can be tabbed with each other so that they occupy 
the same space in the window, with only one shown at a time
</ul>
<p>
Icon toolbars and the <a href="tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line</b></a>
lack their own title bars, but the other methods of control
are still available.
The overall window or any undocked panel can be resized by dragging 
any corner and moved by dragging its title bar.
The boundaries between docked panels or between panel(s) and the
graphics area can be dragged to expand one side and shrink the other
while keeping the overall window dimensions the same.
Finally, the overall window can be toggled to hide/show the current panels 
by clicking the &ldquo;nested squares&rdquo; button
<img width="20px" src="toggle.png"> near its bottom right corner.
This allows expanding the graphics area with a single click
without losing the overall window configuration.
Icon toolbars and the <a href="tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line</b></a>
are excluded from this toggling.

<h3>ChimeraX Browser and Help Viewer</h3>
<p>
The <b>Help Viewer</b> is a built-in HTML browser.
ChimeraX help pages are written in HTML and can be shown in the 
<b>Help Viewer</b> by using the <b>Help</b> menu, the
<a href="commands/help.html"><b>help</b></a> command, tool context menus,
and/or links in the <a href="tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
The <b>Help Viewer</b> opens as a separate window, but can be
docked to and undocked from the main window like other panels,
as described <a href="#panelcontrol">above</a>.
The name listed for the <b>Help Viewer</b> in panel title-bar menus
will be the title of the HTML page it is showing.
</p><p>
The built-in browser provides a simple mechanism to execute 
ChimeraX commands by clicking special links, for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="cxcmd:open 1gcn"><b>open 1gcn</b></a>
<br> &ndash; encoded as &ndash; <br>
<b>&lt;a href="cxcmd:open 1gcn"&gt;open 1gcn&lt;/a&gt;</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
The execution links will only work in the ChimeraX browser, 
not other web browsers.
The <a href="../quickstart/index.html">Quick Start Guide</a> includes
many more examples of executable ChimeraX command links.
</p><p>
Arbitrary web content and HTML files (with or without such special links)
can be shown in the ChimeraX browser with a command:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b><a href="commands/help.html">help</a> <i>URL</i></b>
<br>&ndash; or &ndash;<br>
<b><a href="commands/open.html">open</a> <i>local-file.html</i></b>
</blockquote>
Besides the <b>Help Viewer</b>, other panels with HTML content such as the
<a href="tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a> are also displayed appropriately.
