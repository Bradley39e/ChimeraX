<h3>Display hierarchy</h3>
<p>
There is a <i><b>display hierarchy</b></i>, 
in that display must be enabled at a higher level to reveal
display settings at lower levels. 
Toggling the top level, model display, is convenient for hiding and
showing an entire model without disrupting its detailed appearance.
Whether there are lower levels depends on the type of model: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>atomic <b>model</b> display must be enabled
to reveal the display settings of its individual
<b>atoms</b>, <b>bonds</b>, and per-residue <b>cartoon</b> segments
<li>a <b>bond</b> or <b>pseudobond</b> can only be displayed when both
flanking atoms are displayed, but it can be hidden (undisplayed) independently
<li>molecular-surface <b>model</b> display must be enabled to reveal the 
display settings of its individual per-atom <b>surface patches</b>
</ul>
<p>
Although turning on display at a higher level reveals display status 
at a lower level, it does not change it. For example, turning on model-level 
display will not show atoms with individual display turned off.
