<h3>Pseudobonds</h3>
<p>
A <b><i>pseudobond</i></b></a> is drawn between two atoms to
signify a connection other than a covalent bond, such as a
hydrogen bond, metal coordination bond, or missing peptide segment.
A <b><i>pseudobond model</i></b> is a named set 
of pseudobonds that can be treated collectively.
Pseudobonds can be defined arbitrarily by creating and
opening a <a href="commands/open.html#atomic">pseudobond file</a>.

<a href="commands/hbonds.html"><b>hbonds</b></a>,
<a href="commands/rungs.html"><b>rungs</b></a>,
<a href="commands/struts.html"><b>struts</b></a>

<a name="floaters"></a>
Pseudobonds are only displayed when both of their endpoint atoms are displayed.
However, a backbone atom is considered as displayed when its cartoon is
<a href="commands/cartoon.html#suppress">suppressing</a> the backbone atoms.
Thus, a pseudobond (which goes the atom position)
may appear to be floating in space.
Floating pseudobonds can be hidden with the command 
<b><a href="commands/cartoon.html">cartoon suppress false</a></b>,
with the side effect of showing any backbone atoms that were already
displayed but suppressed.

Commands that act on pseudobonds include
<a href="commands/color.html"><b>color</b></a>,
<a href="commands/style.html"><b>style</b></a>,
<a href="commands/show.html"><b>show</b></a>,
and <a href="commands/crosslinks.html"><b>crosslinks</b></a>.
For example,
an interactive histogram of pseudobond lengths can be plotted with
<a href="commands/crosslinks.html#histogram"><b>crosslinks histogram</b></a>.
The command-line specifiers
<a href="commands/atomspec.html#builtin"><b>hbonds</b></a> and
<a href="commands/atomspec.html#builtin"><b>pbonds</b></a>
refer to hydrogen-bond pseudobonds and all pseudobonds, respectively,
as well as their endpoint atoms.
Certain commands (<a href="commands/color.html"><b>color</b></a>,
<a href="commands/show.html"><b>show</b></a>) may require using
the <b>target p</b> option to indicate acting on pseudobonds
and not their flanking atoms.
