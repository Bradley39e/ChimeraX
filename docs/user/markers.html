<h3>Markers and Links</h3>
<p>
<b><i>Markers</i></b></a> are pseudoatoms that mark points in 3D space.
Markers are implemented as atoms and can be handled in the same ways 
(<a href="commands/atomspec.html">specified</a> in commands,
<a href="selection.html">selected</a>, <i>etc.</i>).
<b><i>Links</i></b> between markers are equivalent to covalent bonds
between atoms.
</p><p>
Markers and links can be created with the mouse
(see <a href="commands/mousemode.html"><b>mousemode</b></a>)
or with certain commands
(<a href="commands/vseries.html#measure"><b>vseries measure</b></a>).
