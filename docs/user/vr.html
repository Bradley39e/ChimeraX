<h3>Starting VR Mode</h3>

<p>
Any models displayed in ChimeraX can be shown in virtual reality headsets
supported by <a href="http://steamvr.com">SteamVR</a>, such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift
and Samsung Odyssey headsets.

<ol>
<li>start <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/" 
target="_blank">SteamVR</a> 
<li>start ChimeraX and open some data, for example, a PDB model:
<blockquote>
<b><a href="commands/open.html">open</a> 2gbp</b> 
</blockquote>
<li>enter the ChimeraX command: 
<blockquote>
<a href="commands/device.html#vr"><b>vr on</b></a>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p>
Models in ChimeraX should then appear in the VR headset.
With the hand controllers (positions shown as colored cones in the headset):
<ul>
<li>models can be moved and rotated by
moving or rotating either controller while squeezing its trigger
<li>models can be scaled up or down (made larger or smaller) by squeezing the
triggers of both controllers and moving them farther apart 
or closer together, respectively
<li>pressing the Vive 
<a href="https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/about-the-controllers.html"
target="_blank">grip button</a> centers and rescales the model
<li>pressing the Vive
<a href="https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/about-the-controllers.html"
target="_blank">menu button</a> shows the desktop user interface in the 
headset, allowing &ldquo;clicking&rdquo; normal desktop controls
such as toolbar icons to control
<a href="tools/moldisplay.html"><b>Molecule Display</b></a> and
<a href="tools/densitymaps.html"><b>Density Maps</b></a>,
and
<a href="tools/mousemodes.html"><b>Mouse Modes</b></a>
icons to assign the hand controller function
</ul>
<p>
The physical room bounds are shown
as a blue mesh when the headset or a hand controller 
comes close to a physical wall (within about a meter).
Models can be scaled to sizes larger than the physical room.
</p><p>
To turn off rendering in the VR headset and re-enable rendering on the 
desktop display, use the ChimeraX command:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="commands/device.html#vr"><b>vr off</b></a>
</blockquote>

<a name="mousemodes"></a>
<p class="nav">
[<a href="#top">back to top: Virtual Reality</a>]
</p>
<h3>Hand Controller Modes</h3>
<p>
Most of the ChimeraX <a href="commands/ui.html#mousemode">mouse modes</a>
can be used with the VR hand controllers.
To assign a mouse mode to a hand controller button:
</p>

<ol>
<li>press the Vive
<a href="https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/about-the-controllers.html"
   target="_blank">menu button</a> to show the desktop user interface in the headset.
   Holding the menu button allows moving the panel in the VR scene.
<li>put the tip of a hand controller cone on a mouse mode icon and click with
<a href="https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/about-the-controllers.html"
   target="_blank">trigger, trackpad, or grip</a> hand controller buttons to assign
that mouse mode to the clicked button
</ol>

<p>
  There are three assignable buttons on each controller,
  so six modes can be assigned. Functions include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selection
  <li>Rotation + translation (single mode)
  <li>Zooming
  <li>Rotate and translate selected model only
  <li>Move clip planes
  <li>Rotate clip planes
  <li>Label atoms
  <li>Change map contour level
  <li>Crop map box
  <li>Place markers, move, resize, delete, connnect markers
  <li>Play 3D image time series
  <li>Rotate bonds
  <li>Tug on atoms with molecular dynamics
  <li>Run molecular dynamics on residue and neighbors
  <li>Swap an amino acid
</ul>

<p>
  Modes that require clicking on an atom such as selection or labeling require pointing at the atom
  with the hand controller cone.  This is easiest to do at close range, although it can work at a distance
  but requires accurate pointing.  Modes that involve dragging on the desktop such as changing the contour
  level of a map or zooming are operated by clicking and moving the hand controller vertically.  The bond
  rotation mouse mode operates by dragging on the desktop, but in VR operates by rotating the hand controller.
  Translation and rotation are separate mouse modes but are a single hand controller mode.

</p>
<h3>Hand Controller Problems</h3>

<p>
  Several factors make it difficult to use the hand controllers.  These problems can be remedied but we
  have not yet had time to fix them.
</p>

<p><b>No click feedback.</b> There is no visual indication when you click a mouse mode icon. The icons are
  small and it is easy to miss. It helps to move the panel close by holding the menu button on the hand
  controller.  The Log panel will show if the mode was changed.
<p><b>No mode indicator.</b> There is no visual indication of what modes are currently assigned to the buttons.
  It is easy to forget the six modes assigned to the two controllers.  In the future we plan to put the mode icon
  on the cone at the location of each of the three assignable buttons.
<p><b>Blackout.</b> Modes that perform calculations taking longer than 1/90th second cause the graphics not
  to update, and the VR scene will gray out after a fraction of a second without graphics updates.  Changing
  map contour level and running molecular dynamics are prone to this problem.  In the future these calculations
  will be done in parallel so the graphics will not be slowed down.
<p><b>Flickering labels.</b> Atom labels or residue labels crated by the swap amino acid mode can cause
  scene flicker because the labels are slow to render.  Graphics optimization is needed.
<p><b>Selection outlines.</b> Green selection outlines can slow rendering and cause flicker.

</p>
<h3>Limitations of Interactive Viewing</h3>
<p>
<font color="red" size="+1"><b>Motion sickness warning</b></font>:
If the model is stuttering or flickering in the headset
(due to insufficient rendering speed), then you should stop viewing it,
as this can easily and suddenly induce nausea that could last as long as
24 hours. Even without the stuttering, 
if you feel any motion sickness, stop using the headset.
Progression from slight nausea to needing to throw up can happen quickly.
</p>
<p>
<b>Small models only</b>.
Large molecular structures (more than a few thousand atoms) render too slowly
and will cause stuttering in the headset.
Large density map surfaces also cause stuttering;
a 200<sup>3</sup> map at full resolution should work, but larger sizes 
may require <a href="tools/volumeviewer.html#step">subsampling</a> (step 2).
Current headsets render at 90 frames per second in two eyes,
so the effective rendering speed needed to avoid flickering is about 
200 frames per second. By comparison, a rendering speed of 10 frames
per second is adequate on a conventional desktop display.
</p>
<p>
<b>Simple lighting</b>.
By default ChimeraX switches to simple lighting when VR is enabled -- other
<a href="commands/lighting.html">lighting modes</a> render too slowly and cause stuttering.
</p><p>
<b>Desktop rendering</b>.
The ChimeraX graphics on your normal computer display will show what the user
sees in the VR headset. Rendering to the conventional display
(generally 60 frames per second) can slow the VR rendering if ChimeraX is not
able to switch to a mode where graphics is not synchronized to vertical refresh.
To test if this is the cause of stuttering you can use the vr command option
<b>mirror false</b> to prevent graphics from updating on the desktop display.
An alternative mirroring can be done by the SteamVR runtime using
SteamVR menu entry &ldquo;Mirror Display.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<b>Side View should be closed</b>.
The ChimeraX <a href="tools/sideview.html"><b>Side View</b></a> tool 
will slow headset rendering and cause stuttering, so it
should be closed during VR viewing.
</p><p>
<b>Operating systems</b>. 
We have tested ChimeraX VR on Windows 10 with an Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 
graphics card and with an AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card.
As of April 2018, SteamVR works well on Windows, has some support on macOS High Sierra,
and is not usable on Linux.
</p><p>
<b>Difficult to change model display</b>.
Changing molecule or map display can be done by removing the headset and using
the ChimeraX  interface in the conventional display with mouse and keyboard.
Alternatively, the desktop can be displayed in the headset 
using the Vive controller
<a href="https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/about-the-controllers.html"
target="_blank">menu button</a>.
Then use the hand controllers to &ldquo;click&rdquo;  icons in the ChimeraX
<a href="tools/moldisplay.html"><b>Molecule Display</b></a>
and <a href="tools/densitymaps.html"><b>Density Maps</b></a> toolbars
to change the display.
</p><p>
<b>Clipping when models far away</b>.
If models are scaled to a very large size, parts more than 
500 meters away (in physical room dimensions) will be clipped.  
This may seem like a large distance, but as a model is scaled up
it may appear to stop increasing in size because
stereoscopic depth perception is not effective beyond about 10 meters.
As parts of the model get both larger and farther away at the same rate, 
the change in size is not evident.
To gauge model size, it can be useful to move a hand controller near 
a physical wall so that the blue mesh will provide a reference distance.
</p><p>
<b>Dynamic scenes may render too slowly.</b>
Dynamic (time-varying) scenes are more interesting to view than static scenes.
We have successfully displayed 3D optical microscopy time series of crawling 
cells using the command
<a href="commands/vseries.html#play"><b>vseries play</b></a>
with the <a href="commands/vseries.html#cacheFrames"><b>cacheFrames</b></a>
option so that all surface depictions are precomputed;
without that option, the VR headset rendering is too slow.
It may also help to change the scene at a slower pace, 
for example using 
<a href="commands/vseries.html#play"><b>vseries play</b></a> with the 
<a href="commands/vseries.html#maxFrameRate"><b>maxFrameRate</b></a> option.
A molecular dynamics trajectories can be played with the
<a href="commands/coordset.html"><b>coordset</b></a> command.  Use the
coordset <b>pauseFrames 9</b> option to slow the playback rate from the
90 frames per second of the headset to 10 frames per second.

<h3>Recording Movies for Cellphone VR</h3>

<p>
In addition to interactive rendering of molecules, ChimeraX can record 360&deg; movies for
playback in less powerful VR headsets, such as those powered by cellphones.
</p>

<p>
ChimeraX can record 360&deg; immersive movies that can be played back on 
virtual reality headsets. An advantage of movies is that they can be
played back even on basic cell-phone VR headsets such as the Samsumg GearVR;
a scene that is too complex to render interactively can be recorded
over a longer period of time and encoded into a movie file.
A drawback of movies is that the viewer cannot move around in the scene &ndash; 
the movie is recorded from one vantage point that may move, but is not 
under the viewer's control (although the viewer can look in any direction
from that vantage point).
</p><p>
To record a 360&deg; movie in ChimeraX, set the 
camera mode to a 360&deg; format (for example, with
command <a href="commands/camera.html"><b>camera 360sbs</b></a>).
For stereoscopic movies, two eye views are recorded and the image frames 
for the two eyes are placed side by side 
(<a href="commands/camera.html"><b>360sbs</b></a>)
or left eye on top of right eye 
(<a href="commands/camera.html"><b>360tb</b></a>).
There is also a monoscopic 360&deg; format
(<a href="commands/camera.html"><b>360</b></a>),
although it does not provide direct depth perception
when the movie is played back in a headset.
The ChimeraX <a href="commands/movie.html#record"><b>movie record</b></a> and 
<a href="commands/movie.html#encode"><b>movie encode</b></a> commands 
are used to record the movie frames and assemble them into a single movie file.
Other ChimeraX commands can be used to change the viewpoint,
display styles, and colors during recording
(see <a href="images.html">making images</a> and
<a href="movies.html">making movies</a>).

<a href="flypore.png">
<img class="outline" width="600px" style="margin:4px" src="flypore.png" 
alt="nuclear pore 360-degree view" title="click to enlarge..."></a>

<p>
The following ChimeraX command script (<a href="flypore.cxc">flypore.cxc</a>)
loads a density map of the human nuclear pore,
sets the camera mode, and records a movie flying through the pore.
The data coordinates are in &Aring;, so the commands also use those units.
The viewpoint moves 2000 &Aring; (200 nm)
towards the pore in increments of 1 &Aring;.
</p>
<pre>
      # Open human nuclear pore density map.
      open 3103 from emdb

      # Set contour level for density map surface
      vol #1 level 2.5

      # Move 1500 Angstroms closer before starting movie
      move z 1500

      # Set stereoscopic side-by-side 360 degree camera mode with eye separation to 25 Angstroms
      camera 360sbs eyeSeparation 25

      # Start capturing movie frames 4800 by 1200 pixels
      movie record size 4800,1200

      # Move into pore with 2000 steps each 1 Angstrom
      move z 1 2000

<h3>Movie Details</h3>
<p>
Movie file 
<!-- #374 cx help viewer doesn't play the movie -->
(not shown in the <a href="tools/browser.html">ChimeraX browser</a>; 
copy link to a standard browser to view):
<a href="http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/vr-dec2016/images/flypore.mp4"
target="_blank">flypore.mp4</a>
</p><p>
<b>Movie duration</b>.
The movie is 2000 frames at 90 frames per second, for a running 
time of 22 seconds. It is encoded in H.264 format, and the file
size of 27 Mbytes gives a data rate of about 100 Mbytes/minute or 
6 Gbytes/hour; however, compression is better than usual 
because the motion in the movie is very slow.
The disk space used by the uncompressed (ppm format) image frames before 
the movie was encoded was about 33 Gbytes, about 1000x the final size 
&ndash; recording a long movie requires a lot of disk space.
Rendering the movie took about 15 minutes, or 30x slower than real time.
</p><p>
<b>Eye separation / physical scale</b>.
In recording a stereoscopic (two-eye) movie, 
it is important to choose an appropriate eye separation
in the units of the scene, typically &Aring;.
This controls how large and nearby the models will appear in the headset.
For the nuclear pore, which is 1000 &Aring; in diameter with
a channel diameter of about 500 &Aring;, the script sets the eye separation 
to 25 &Aring;. Thus, the channel diameter will appear to be 20x
(500/25) the actual eye separation.  For example,
if a viewer's eyes are actually two inches apart, 
the channel diameter will appear to be 40 inches.
</p><p>
<b>Lighting and shadows</b>.
Lighting is problematic in 360&deg; modes. Simple lighting 
(command <a href="commands/lighting.html"><b>light simple</b></a>)
provides one directional light and one fill light, both positioned for 
viewing along &ndash;Z in scene coordinates.  
When viewed from the opposite direction, models will not have any 
diffuse or specular lighting highlights, just flat coloring.
The same is true of <b>full</b> lighting.  With <b>soft</b> lighting
(command <a href="commands/lighting.html"><b>light soft</b></a>)
ambient lighting from all directions with shadowing is used,
but there is no directional light.
</p><p>
<b>Only default model locations</b>.
The stereoscopic 360&deg; mode does not work correctly 
(scene depth is wrong) for models that have been moved within the scene. 
This is a bug in OpenGL shaders.
The mode does work correctly for camera motions 
(moving the whole scene collectively), as in the above script.
</p><p>
<b>Movie resolution and format</b>.
It is desirable to at least match the resolution of the headset.
Current headsets have 1200 pixels in the vertical dimension. 
Recording at a higher resolution can be advantageous because the VR headset 
distorts the image to correct for lens optics, making some image pixels larger.
The width of the side-by-side video should be four times the height.
The left- and right-eye images are each an equirectangular projection where
longitude angle goes from 0 to 360&deg; along the horizontal axis
and latitude angle goes from &ndash;90 to 90&deg; along the vertical axis.
To make image pixels have equal angular height and width, the movie should
have a 4:1 aspect ratio. 
The ChimeraX graphics window need not have this aspect ratio,
as the pixel dimensions can be specified in the
<a href="commands/movie.html#record"><b>movie record</b></a> command.
</p><p>
<b>Stereoscopic eye positions</b>.
The movie includes views from two side-by-side cameras representing 
a viewer's eyes.
In (nonvirtual) reality, eye positions depend on the direction of viewing.
Since the movie is recorded without knowing the viewing direction,
each vertical strip (meridian) is rendered as if one were looking directly
at that strip, with eye-to-eye line perpendicular to view direction.
The resulting movie provides good stereoscopic perception when viewed
360&deg; along the equator, although it is strictly only correct at the 
central vertical strip in the field of view.
The north- and south-pole directions (where the meridians meet) 
will not provide good stereoscopic depth perception.
</p><p>
<b>Movie frame rate</b>.
To minimize flickering during fast object motion,
it is best to encode the movie for playback at a frame rate matching
that of the headset, 90 frames per second with current VR headsets.
