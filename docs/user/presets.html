<h3>Presets</h3>
<p>
A <b><i>preset</i></b> is a predefined combination of display settings.
Choosing an entry from the <b>Presets</b> menu 
is easier than adjusting the associated settings individually.
</p><p>
The current set of presets is based directly on
<a href="autostyle.html">automatic styling</a> and is likely to change:
<ul>
<li><b>Original Look</b> - initial appearance from
<a href="autostyle.html">automatic styling</a>,
which depends on the number of chains in an atomic structure
(however, certain aspects of appearance
like <a href="commands/set.html#silhouettes">silhouettes</a>
or <a href="commands/cartoon.html#style">cartoon style</a>
may differ if they have been changed since the structure was opened)
<li><b>Cartoon</b>
- <a href="commands/cartoon.html">cartoons</a> plus atomic detail near
residues <a href="commands/atomspec.html#surfcats">classified</a> 
as <b>ligand</b> and <b>ions</b>,
<a href="commands/lighting.html">simple lighting</a>, <i>etc.</i>
(as for 
<a href="autostyle.html">automatic styling</a> of structures with 1-4 chains)
<li><b>Space-Filling (chain colors)</b>
- all atoms as <a href="commands/style.html">spheres</a>
except sticks for <b>ligand</b> and balls for <b>solvent</b>,
<a href="commands/colortables.html#autocolors">chain colors</a>,
shadows, <i>etc.</i> (as for
<a href="autostyle.html">automatic styling</a> of structures with 5-249 chains)
<li><b>Space-Filling (single color)</b>
- all atoms as <a href="commands/style.html">spheres</a>,
ambient-only lighting, <i>etc.</i> (as for
<a href="autostyle.html">automatic styling</a> of structures with &ge;250 chains)
<li><b>Stick</b>
- all atoms as <a href="commands/style.html">sticks</a>,
<a href="commands/lighting.html">simple lighting</a>, <i>etc.</i> (as for
<a href="autostyle.html">automatic styling</a> of structures with 0 chains)
</ul>
<p>
More render-intensive presets such as <b>Cartoon</b>
may exhibit slow performance on very large structures.
