<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Build Structure</h3>
<p>
The <b>Build Structure</b> tool is for building and modifying atomic structures.
It is implemented as the
<a href="../commands/build.html"><b>build</b></a> command.
See also:
<a href="rotamers.html"><b>Rotamers</b></a>,
<a href="modeller.html"><b>Modeller Comparative</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/torsion.html"><b>torsion</b></a>
</p><p>
<b>Build Structure</b> can be opened from the 
<b>Structure Editing</b> section of the <b>Tools</b> menu and 
manipulated like other panels (<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).
</p><p>
Currently it includes just one section, <b>Modify Structure</b>,
which can be used to change the element,
valence (number of directly attached atoms), and/or geometry
(spatial arrangement of attached atoms) of a single
<a href="../selection.html">selected</a> atom at a time.
Hydrogens are appended as needed to fill the valence.
Building outward can be done by successive cycles
of modifying a hydrogen attached to the previously modified atom.
<!--
</p><p>
The <b>Modify Structure</b> dialog can be opened directly
by doubleclick-<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>
an atom when 0 or &gt;3 other atoms are already
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a>, then choosing
<b>Modify Atom</b> from the resulting
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html#contextmenus">context menu</a>.
-->
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> will change the
<a href="../selection.html">selected</a> atom as specified:
<ul>
<li><b>Element</b> &ndash; desired element
<li><b>Bonds</b> &ndash; desired total number of substituents on the atom
(0-4 allowed); pre-existing atoms are not removed, so this number must
be no less than the atom's current number of substituents.
Substituents can be deleted beforehand, such as with the <b>Delete</b>
button near the bottom of the dialog.
<li><b>Geometry</b> &ndash; target arrangement of bonds around the atom
  <ul>
  <li><b>linear</b> &ndash; allowed for 2 bonds, target bond angle 180&deg;
  <li><b>trigonal</b> &ndash; allowed for 2-3 bonds,
  target bond angle(s) 120&deg; in a plane
  <li><b>tetrahedral</b> &ndash; allowed for 2-4 bonds,
  target bond angle(s) 109.5&deg;
  </ul>
<p>
There is no checking as to whether the chosen number of bonds 
and geometry are chemically reasonable.
Hydrogens will be added to the atom to generate the indicated
number of bonds.
If the atom is already bonded to one (and only one) other atom, the bond
will be adjusted to an <b><i>approximate</i></b> length depending
on the elements involved.
The positions of any other atoms already present will not be changed.
New hydrogens will be placed to form the idealized angles for the geometry,
or if the atom already has two or more
substituents, to maximally avoid those substituents.
Bond lengths for X-H (X = C/N/O/S) are taken from the
<a href="http://ambermd.org/" target="_blank"><b>Amber</b></a>
parm99 parameters.
</p><p>
<li style="list-style-type:none">Choices for atom name:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Retain current atom name</b>
  <li><b>Set atom name to [<i>name</i>]</b>
  </ul>
<p>
In <a href="http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/sect9.html#ATOM" target="_blank">PDB format</a>,
an atom name can be up to four characters long and should be unique
within a residue. An atom name normally starts with the element symbol.
</p>
<li><b>Connect to pre-existing atoms if appropriate</b>
(initial default <b>on</b>)
&ndash; if a newly added hydrogen would be very close to
an existing atom in the same model as the
<a href="../selection.html">selected</a> atom, discard
the hydrogen and form a bond to the existing atom instead
<li><b>Focus view on modified residue</b>
(initial default <b>off</b>) &ndash; 
<a href="../commands/view.html#initial">focus the view</a> on the
the residue containing the modified atom
<li><b>Color new atoms by element</b> 
(initial default <b>on</b>) &ndash; 
color-code the modified atom and any newly added hydrogens
<a href="../commands/colortables.html#element">by element</a>
</ul><ul>
<li style="list-style-type:none">Choices for <b>Residue Name</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Leave unchanged</b>
  <li><b>Change modified residue's name to [<i>resname</i>]</b>
&ndash; change the residue name to <i>resname</i>
for all atoms in the residue, not just the modified atom
(appropriate when a standard residue is modified; for example,
a methylated lysine should no longer be named LYS)
  <li><b>Put just changed atoms in new residue named [<i>resname</i>]</b>
&ndash; put the modified atom and any new hydrogens
in a new residue named <i>resname</i>;
otherwise, they will be included in the atom's current residue
  </ul>
<p>
In <a href="http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/sect9.html#ATOM" target="_blank">PDB format</a>,
residue names are normally three characters long and chain identifiers a
single character.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
Clicking <b>Delete</b> removes the
<a href="../selection.html">selected</a> atoms and bonds.
