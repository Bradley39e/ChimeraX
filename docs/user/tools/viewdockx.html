<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: ViewDockX</h3>
<p>
<b>ViewDockX</b> is a tool for the interactive analysis of
molecular docking results.
Users can click through a list of docked compounds (or different
poses of the same compound) to view them individually in the context
of a binding site. Results can be sorted, rated, and saved,
and scores or other numerical descriptors can be plotted.
See also: 
<a href="../commands/hbonds.html"><b>hbonds</b></a>,
<a href="../commands/clashes.html"><b>clashes</b></a>,
an <a href="../formats/dock4.mol2">example file</a> of compounds docked to 
H-ras (the protein part of PDB entry
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=121p"
target="_blank">121p</a>)
</p><p>
After one or more files of
<a href="../commands/open.html#docking">docking results</a> have been
opened, choosing <b>ViewDockX</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu shows a table 
listing the different compounds or poses.
The <a href="#table"><b>ViewDockX</b> table</a> and associated 
<a href="#plots">plots</a> can be manipulated
like other panels in ChimeraX (<a href="../window.html#panels">more...</a>).

</p>
<h3>ViewDockX Table</h3>
<p>
In the table of docking results, the rows are different compounds or
different positions of a compound, and the columns show additional data
read from the input, typically including compound names
and docking scores. The first three columns are generated automatically:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>S</b> - show/hide checkboxes
<li><b>RATING</b> - star rating
<li><b>ID</b> - model identification number, 
which can be clicked to show the model and hide all others listed in the table
</ul>
<p>
Any additional columns that appear when the tool is first started
directly reflect information read from the input file(s).
Available columns of information can be hidden from the table and reshown
by clicking the arrowhead near the top right corner of the table
and using the resulting checkbox menu. 
Clicking the header of a column sorts by the values in that column.
</p><p>
Buttons above the table:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Show All Structures</b> - show structures for all table rows
<li><b>Plot</b> - <a href="#plots">plot</a>
one or more numerical descriptors for all table rows
<li><b>Save...</b> - for all table rows, save structures and descriptors 
(including current star ratings) to a Mol2 file; the file can be
reopened later for further analysis with <b>ViewDockX</b>
<li><b>Close</b> - close any structures with star ratings no greater 
than the specified number of stars, and remove their rows from the table
</ul>
<p>
<b>H-BONDS</b> between a docked compound and a receptor structure can be
calculated as described for the 
<a href="../commands/hbonds.html"><b>hbonds</b></a> command
and included as an additional column.

</p>
<h3>Plotting</h3>
<p>
Clicking the <b>Plot</b> button near the top left of the
<a href="#table"><b>ViewDockX</b> table</a> opens another window for
plotting the table entries by their numerical descriptors.
In the plotting window, one of the numerical descriptors can be chosen 
for the <b>Sort</b> order, and all or a subset of them as values to <b>Plot</b>.
Multiple plotting windows can be shown for the same set of docking
results.
</p><p>
Pausing the cursor over a plotted point shows the corresponding
model number, name, and value. Clicking the point shows only that model
(amongst the models in the set of docking results).
