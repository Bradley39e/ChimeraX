<h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Send to Quest</h3>
<p>
This tool sends a scene to an Oculus Quest VR headset to be viewed by the 
LookSee application. See
<a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/data/looksee-mar2023/looksee.html"
target="_blank">ChimeraX VR on standalone Quest headsets</a>
for how to install LookSee on a Quest 2 or Quest Pro headset.
See also: <a href="../vr.html">ChimeraX virtual reality</a>
</p><p>
The scene must be simple enough for the Quest 2 or Quest Pro graphics to handle 
without flickering. If the room is shown (with pass-through video) the scene
should have &lt;700,000 million triangles, and with room not shown 
(black background) &lt;900,000 triangles.
</p><p>
In the LookSee app, clicking the A or X hand-controller button
will show the user interface, and clicking &ldquo;Open new files&rdquo;
will make new files sent from ChimeraX automatically display.
There may be up to a 5-second delay displaying a new file.
