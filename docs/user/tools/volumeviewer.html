<b><i>Volume data</i></b> is a broad term for
density maps, electrostatic potential maps, 3D imaging data, and other 
data sets with numerical values associated with points on a 3D grid.
</p><p>
<b>Volume Viewer</b> is a graphical interface for adjusting contour levels
and other aspects of volume data display.
Alternatively, these settings and more can be adjusted with the 
<a href="../commands/volume.html"><b>volume</b></a> command.
Volume data can be opened with the command
<a href="../commands/open.html"><b>open</b></a>
(which automatically starts <b>Volume Viewer</b>) and saved to a file with 
<a href="../commands/save.html"><b>save</b></a>.

The <b>Volume Viewer</b> window can be manipulated
like other panels in ChimeraX (<a href="../window.html#toolstart">more...</a>).
</p><p>
By default, a data set will be displayed automatically if it does not
exceed a certain size
(see <a href="../commands/volume.html"><b>volume</b></a> command option
<a href="../commands/volume.html#dispopen"><b>showOnOpen</b></a>), 
although it may be subsampled
(see <a href="../commands/volume.html"><b>volume</b></a> command option
<a href="../commands/volume.html#autostep"><b>limitVoxelCount</b></a>).
</ul>
<p>
A histogram of values is shown for each data set.
Above the histogram (from left to right) are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the model name and number
<li>dimensions in grid units of the <a href="#region">display region</a>
<li>the <a href="#step">step size</a> (subsampling)
<li>an <b>eye icon</b> for showing/hiding the model
<li> color and level of the <a href="#threshold">threshold</a>
most recently moved or clicked
<li>the range of values in the <a href="#region">display region</a>
<li>a pulldown menu with display styles:
  <ul>
  <li><b>surface</b> (default) - solid isosurfaces
  <li><b>mesh</b> - mesh isosurfaces
  <li><b>image</b> - cloudlike with varying intensity and opacity
  </ul>
<li>a <b>minus-sign button</b> for closing the model
</ul>
<p>
<a name="step"></a>
The <b>step</b> setting controls <b><i>subsampling</i></b>;
a value  of <b>1</b> means all the data points are used
to generate the display, while <b>2</b>
means every other data point is taken along each axis,
reducing the number of points used by a factor of eight.
Step sizes can be different in the X, Y, and Z directions,
although this can only be set with the 
<a href="../commands/volume.html"><b>volume</b></a> command
<a href="../commands/volume.html#sampling"><b>step</b></a> option
(not with the graphical interface).
</p><p>
<a name="region"></a>
The <b><i>display region</i></b> is not necessarily the full extent
of the data grid; it can be limited with the
<a href="../commands/volume.html"><b>volume</b></a> command
<a href="../commands/volume.html#dimensions"><b>region</b></a> option.
</p><p>
<a name="threshold"></a>
The <b><i>thresholds</i></b> on the histogram control how data values 
are mapped to the display:
<blockquote>
<b>surface</b> or <b>mesh</b><br>
Each threshold (contour level) is shown on the histogram as a vertical bar
that can be moved horizontally.
For unsigned data types, an initial threshold is set so that 1% of voxels
(1% of the volume encompassed by the data region) lie above it;
for signed data types, positive and negative thresholds are placed
symmetrically about zero.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>image</b><br>
Each threshold is shown as a small square that can be moved horizontally
and/or vertically.
For unsigned data types, initial thresholds are set to give zero intensity
for the 10% of voxels (in the data region) with the lowest values,
scaling up to 0.99 intensity for the 1% of voxels
with the highest values;
for signed data types, positive and negative thresholds are placed
symmetrically about zero.
The thresholds and connecting lines on each histogram define a 
<a href="../commands/volume.html#transferfunction">transfer function</a>
that maps data values to colors and intensities.
The rightmost threshold does not have to be at the far right of the histogram,
and a threshold at a lower data value can be higher (vertically)
than a threshold at a higher data value.
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
Thresholds can be added or deleted using the context menu from 
right-clicking<a href="../window.html#mac-context">*</a> on the histogram.
Each threshold is shown in the same color as its display.
The color and level shown above the histogram apply
to the threshold most recently moved or clicked.
The color, including opacity, can be changed by clicking the 
color square and using the resulting color chooser.
The level can be changed by entering a different value 
or by dragging the threshold.
Holding the Shift key down reduces the speed (mouse sensitivity) of threshold
dragging tenfold, allowing finer control.
</p><p>
Histogram ranges and threshold levels are given in the same units as the
data. The <a href="../commands/volume.html"><b>volume</b></a>
command also allows specifying threshold levels in units of
root-mean-square deviations from zero or standard deviations from the mean.
