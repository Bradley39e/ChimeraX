<h3>Tool: Command Line Interface</h3>
<p>
<a href="../index.html#commands">ChimeraX commands</a>
are entered at the <b>Command Line Interface</b>.
This interface can be opened from the <b>Tools</b> menu 
or shown/hidden with the <b>toolshed</b> command.
</p><p>
Sometimes it is necessary to click in the graphics window or
command line to take back focus from some other dialog so that command 
keystrokes will register.
</p><p>
When the focus is in the command line or graphics window,
<b>Ctrl-u</b> erases the command line contents,
<b>Ctrl-k</b> erases from the cursor position to the end of line,
and the command history can be navigated with
<b>Ctrl-p</b> (previous command) and <b>Ctrl-n</b> (next command).
Additionally pressing <b>Shift</b> indicates navigating to
the next/previous occurrence of the same command name
(initial set of characters)
instead of to whatever command is immediately adjacent in the history.
Navigation skips commands for which the entire line is identical.
When the mouse focus is in the command line (not the graphics window),
another way to navigate the history is with
the keyboard <b>up arrow</b> and <b>down arrow</b>,
alone or in combination with <b>Shift</b>.
</p><p>
The inverted triangle to the right of the command line marks a pulldown menu.
The menu includes:
<ul>
<li>the most recently entered commands
<li><b>Command History...</b> for showing the full
<a href="#history"><b>Command History</b></a>
<li><b>Remove duplicate consecutive commands</b> -
where the same command was used multiple times in a row,
remove all but one occurrence from the history
</ul>

<a name="history"></a>

Command History</h3>
<p>
The <b>Command History</b> lists previously used commands.
The commands can be re-executed and/or saved to a file.
The <b>Command History</b> can be opened from the pulldown menu marked by 
a triangle or chevron
to the right of the <a href="#top"><b>Command Line Interface</b></a>.
See also: <a href="log.html"><b>Log</b></a>
</p><p>
In the <b>Command History</b>,
individual commands or blocks of commands may be
<b><i>chosen</i></b> (highlighted) using the left mouse button.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click adds to an existing choice rather than replacing it.
To choose a block of commands without dragging,
click on the first (or last) and then <b>Shift</b>-click on the
last (or first) in the desired block.
</p><p>
<b>Record...</b> brings up a dialog for saving or appending commands to a 
text file. The chosen commands or all commands in the history can be saved.
The filename suffix <b>.cxc</b> is recommended for
<a href="../commands/usageconventions.html#cxc-files">ChimeraX command 
files</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Execute</b> executes the chosen commands in the order shown;
double-clicking an individual command executes that command.
<b>Delete</b> removes the chosen commands from the history.
<b>Copy</b> copies the chosen commands as plain text that can be
pasted into another application window.
</p><p>
The history is stored in a file and carries over between
different ChimeraX sessions.
