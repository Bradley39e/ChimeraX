<p>
The <b>vr</b> command enables a virtual reality mode 
for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift systems.
The mode uses <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/"
target="_blank">SteamVR</a>, which must be installed separately by the user
and started before the mode is enabled.
In addition, Oculus Rift users should start the Oculus runtime 
before starting SteamVR.
Synonyms for <b>on</b>: true, True, 1.
Synonyms for <b>off</b>: false, False, 0.
</p><p>
The transformation between room coordinates
(in meters, with origin at room center) and scene coordinates
(typically in &Aring;) can be specified or reported with
<b>vr roomPosition</b>. The transformation <i>matrix</i> is given as
12 numbers separated by commas only, corresponding to a 3x3 matrix 
for rotation and scaling, with a translation vector in the fourth column.
Ordering is row-by-row, such that the translation vector is given as 
the fourth, eighth, and twelfth numbers.
