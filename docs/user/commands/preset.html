</h3>
<p>
A <b><i>preset</i></b> is a predefined combination of display settings.
The <b>preset</b> command applies one of the following presets (also available 
from the <a href="../menu.html#presets"><b>Presets</b> menu</a>):
<ul>
<li><b>Original Look</b> - initial appearance from
<a href="../autostyle.html">automatic styling</a>,
which depends on the number of chains in an atomic structure
(however, certain aspects of appearance
like <a href="set.html#silhouettes">silhouettes</a>
and <a href="cartoon.html#style">cartoon style</a>
may differ if they have been changed since the structure was opened)
<li><b>Sticks</b>
- all atoms as <a href="style.html">sticks</a>,
<a href="lighting.html">simple lighting</a>, <i>etc.</i> (as for
<a href="../autostyle.html">automatic styling</a> of structures with 0 chains)
<li><b>Cartoon</b>
- <a href="cartoon.html">cartoon</a> plus atomic detail near
residues <a href="atomspec.html#surfcats">classified</a>
as <b>ligand</b> and <b>ions</b>,
<a href="lighting.html">simple lighting</a>, <i>etc.</i>
(as for
<a href="../autostyle.html">automatic styling</a> of structures with 1-4 chains)
<li><b>Space-Filling (chain colors)</b>
- all atoms as <a href="style.html">spheres</a>
except sticks for <b>ligand</b> and balls for <b>solvent</b>,
<a href="colortables.html#autocolors">chain colors</a>,
shadows, <i>etc.</i> (as for <a href="../autostyle.html">automatic styling</a>
of structures with 5-249 chains)
<li><b>Space-Filling (single color)</b>
- all atoms as <a href="style.html">spheres</a>,
ambient-only lighting, <i>etc.</i> (as for <a href="../autostyle.html">automatic
styling</a> of structures with &ge;250 chains)
</ul>
<p>
The current set of presets is based directly on
<a href="../autostyle.html">automatic styling</a> and is likely to change.
Render-intensive presets such as <b>Cartoon</b>
may exhibit slow performance on very large structures.
</p><p>
The <i>preset-name</i> must be enclosed in quotation marks if it
includes spaces, but it can be partial, and capitalization is ignored.
Later, when there are multiple categories, a <i>category</i>
can be specified if needed for disambiguation. 
So far there is only one category, <b>Initial Styles</b>.
Example commands:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>preset orig
<br>
preset chain
<br>
preset init chain</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Matching is prioritized as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>If a single argument (word or quoted string) is given, it is
matched to preset name, any category.
<li>If multiple arguments are given:
 <ol>
 <li>If the first argument matches a category, 
the rest is matched to preset name.
 <li>If a match still has not been found at this point,
the entire set of arguments is matched to preset name, any category.
 </ol>
</ol>
