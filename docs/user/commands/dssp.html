<h3>Command: dssp</h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:

The <b>dssp</b> command identifies helices and strands in protein
atomic coordinates. It is an implementation of the algorithm for 
<b>D</b>efining the <b>S</b>econdary <b>S</b>tructure of
<b>P</b>roteins described in:

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6667333" target="_blank">
Dictionary of protein secondary structure: pattern recognition of 
hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features.</a>

<i>Biopolymers.</i> 1983 Dec;22(12):2577-637.
</blockquote>
Per-residue helix and strand assignments are
used for drawing protein <a href="cartoon.html">cartoons</a>.
<!--
and may be used by
MatchMaker, depending on its settings.
-->
In PDB format, secondary structure assignments are described in HELIX and 
SHEET records, and analogous information is included in mmCIF files.
However, not all input files include this information.
When a protein structure without secondary structure assignments
is read in, <b>dssp</b> is invoked automatically.
<!--
It is also called automatically when
MatchMaker is used with the
<b>Compute secondary structure assignments</b> option,
regardless of whether secondary structure assignments already exist.
-->
</p><p>
The calculation applies to all protein/peptide chains in models 
containing the <a href="atomspec.html">specified</a> atoms.
The coordinates of protein backbone atoms (N, CA, C, O, and optionally H)
are used to identify hydrogen bonds, which in turn define
which residues are in helices and strands. If an amide
hydrogen is not present, it is placed 1.01 &Aring; from N along the bisector
of (1) the vector opposite the bisector of C-N-CA, and (2) the vector
opposite the C-O vector from the previous amino acid.
</p><p>
The <b>energyCutoff</b> <i>c</i> specifies the least favorable (maximum)
estimated energy required to classify an interaction as a hydrogen bond.
The default is <b>&ndash;0.5</b> kcal/mol, as recommended
by Kabsch and Sander, who add that &ldquo;A good H-bond has about &ndash;3
kcal/mol binding energy.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The <b>minHelixLen</b> <i>N</i> and <b>minStrandLen</b> <i>M</i> specify the
mininum number of residues in a helix or strand, respectively,
and both default to <b>3</b>. Single-residue strands should not be allowed,
as there are bridges in many structures that would confuse the
algorithm for identifying sheets.
</p><p>
The <b>report</b> option (default <b>false</b>) indicates whether to
report detailed results in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>, 
including helix and strand residue ranges and 
whether ladder (strand-pair) relationships are parallel or antiparallel.
The last section lists each protein residue followed by various symbols.
The notation is similar to that used by Kabsch and Sander, but is in a 
vertical instead of horizontal format. There are 6 single-character
fields after the residue specifier, each preceded by a single space;
if a field is blank, none of the values apply:
