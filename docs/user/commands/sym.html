<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:

</h3>

<p>
The <b>sym</b> command generates assemblies of atomic models read from
<a href="http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/docs/faqs/pdbx-mmcif-faq-general.html"
target="_blank">mmCIF</a>.
See also:
<a href="open.html"><b>open</b></a>,
<a href="close.html"><b>close</b></a>,
<a href="surface.html"><b>surface</b></a>
</p><p>
If only a <a href="atomspec.html"><i>model-spec</i></a> is given,
the available assemblies and their identifiers are listed in the
<a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
</p><p>
An assembly <i>identifier</i> is a character string, usually a number.
Besides which assembly to show, there is a choice of 
how to represent the symmetry copies:
</p><p>
By default, the added copies are simply graphical clones of
the original structure, and cannot be displayed in different styles and
structures from the original.
</p><p>
With the <b>copies</b> option, the assembly is instead added as a
separate model in which each submodel 
can be displayed and colored independently of the others.
Adding all copies as independent (sub)models rather than as graphical clones
requires more memory and may not be practical for larger assemblies.
The original atomic model is hidden but not closed automatically,
even though the same parts of the assembly are also included in the new model.
</p><p>
For a simple appearance and economical use of memory,
the <b>surfaceOnly</b> option indicates calculating per-chain 
surfaces for the original structure and then showing only surfaces
for the copies. The surfaces can be created as graphical clones, 
or if <b>copies</b> is also used, as molecular surface models 
that can be displayed and colored independently of one another
(along with their underlying full atomic data).
The surface calculation is the same as for the
<a href="surface.html"><b>surface</b></a> command
with default <a href="surface.html#parameters">parameters</a>:
<ul>
<li>If <b>resolution</b> is not specified, solvent-excluded surfaces
will be calculated (probe radius 1.4 &Aring;).
<li>If <b>resolution</b> is specified, low-resolution Gaussian surfaces
will be calculated instead.  For each biopolymer chain,
a pseudo-density map is generated by summing over atoms, 
where each atom is described as a Gaussian distribution 
of width proportional to the <b>resolution</b> <i>r</i>
and amplitude equal to the atomic number. 
An isosurface is displayed and the pseudo-density map discarded.
<li>Both types of surface are calculated on a grid,
with spacing 0.5 &Aring; for an SES and 0.1<i>r</i>
(one-tenth the resolution value) for a Gaussian surface.
</ul>
<p>
The <b>clear</b> keyword indicates removing all graphical clones
of the specified model(s). 
Additional models such as from using the <b>copies</b> option are not removed.
</p><p>
Even when <b>copies</b> is not used,
one or more copies of the full atomic model may be added, namely
when the assembly specifies different sets of matrices for different chains.
In that case, restoring the original state may require not only using 
<b>clear</b> but also <a href="close.html">closing</a> the added model(s) and 
<a href="show.html">showing</a> all chains of the original copy
(some chains may have been hidden when the assembly was shown).
