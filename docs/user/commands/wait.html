<h3>Command: wait</h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>wait</b> [ <i>wait-frames</i> ]</h3>
<p>
<b>Wait</b> updates the display for a specified number of 
<i>wait-frames</i> before allowing execution of the next command in a script.
It can also be used to generate duplicate image frames in movies
(like <a href="movie.html#duplicate"><b>movie duplicate</b></a>).
</p>

<h4><a name="ordered">Ordered Command Execution</a></h4>
<p>
Following certain multi-frame commands,
<b>wait</b> without a number will automatically wait the needed number 
of frames for the command to finish (see the
<a href="http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/midas/wait.html#whichcmds">Chimera1 list</a>
of such commands; other commands require the number to be given explicitly).
In the following example, <b>wait</b> prevents <b>move</b>
from starting until <b>roll</b> has finished:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>roll y 3 120</b>
<br><b>wait</b>
<br><b>move x 0.2 75</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is also acceptable to give the frame argument where it could have been
omitted (in the example, <b>wait 120</b> instead of just <b>wait</b>).
</p><p>
Unlike Chimera1, when executing a command file,
Chimera2 does not add an implicit <b>wait 1</b> at the end of each line
that could change the display.
Thus, after a series of commands is saved
from the <a href="../tools/cli.html#history"><b>Command History</b></a> 
or otherwise written to a text file to create a 
<a href="open.html#local">Chimera2 command script</a>,
it may be necessary to add <b>wait</b> or
<b>wait <i>N</i></b> commands between them 
(or appended to lines with a semicolon separator)
to see the effects of individual commands as they are executed and/or
enforce their ordered execution.
</p> 

<h4><a name="duplicates">Duplicate Image Frames in Movies</a></h4>
<p>
Stretches of duplicate image frames correspond to periods of time
where objects remain static. If motion occurs in the last few frames 
of a movie, due to the encoding process it may appear to end on a blur.
This effect can be avoided by including a few wait frames 
(<b>wait 5</b> or similar) at the end of scripted movie content.
