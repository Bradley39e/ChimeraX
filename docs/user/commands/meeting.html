The <b>meeting</b> command lets two or more ChimeraX instances 
running on different computers to view the same scene.
Its main purpose is to allow multi-person 
<a href="../vr.html">virtual reality</a> (VR) sessions in ChimeraX, 
although it can also be used without VR.  
Its main function is to show a head image and hand controller pointers, 
or if not using VR, the mouse pointer for each participant, so that
other participants can see them pointing at atoms in the scene.
Aside from synchronizing pointers, the <b>meeting</b> command will 
copy a session from the ChimeraX instance that initiates the meeting 
(using <b>meeting start</b>) to each person who joins the meeting
(using <b>meeting</b> <i>host</i>, where <i>host</i> is the hostname
or IP address of the starting instance, for example, 
<b>descartes.cgl.ucsf.edu</b> or <b>169.230.21.39</b>).
This copying is done only when a person joins the meeting. 
Subsequently if any participant opens a new model
or changes the display of existing models, 
those changes do not appear for the other participants.
If a particpant using VR moves the scene,
then others using VR will see the motion.
The model positions do not change for participants not using VR
&mdash; each of those users maintains their own preferred viewing direction.
In VR, the hand controller motion is tracked at a somewhat
slow rate of about 10 updates per second.
For non-VR users the mouse pointer is not tracked continuously;
the mouse position is only displayed to others when it hovers over an atom.
VR hand controller and mouse positions in the scene are shown with cones.
</p><p>
This command is under development and is currently rudimentary.
In the future we hope to synchronize changes 
to model display, molecule display styles, colors, and other changes.
The command does not provide an audio connection, 
so for remote participants, it is necessary to set up a separate audio link.
