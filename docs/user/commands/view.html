<p>
The <b>view</b> command moves the camera so that the
<a href="atomspec.html">specified</a> items fill the graphics window.
It also allows naming and later restoring the camera viewpoint.

<a href="zoom.html"><b>zoom</b></a>
</p><p>
Only the displayed parts of the specified items are used for calculating
the new view. If nothing is specified, all displayed items will be included.
The center of rotation is fixed at the 
center of the bounding box of the specified items (displayed parts only),
or if nothing is specified, allowed to vary according to the
<a href="cofr.html#method">front center method</a>.
The <b>orient</b> option rotates the camera to a standard orientation
with scene X-axis horizontal increasing rightward,
Y-axis vertical increasing upward,
and Z-axis perpendicular to the screen increasing toward the viewer.
</p><p>
The <b>name</b> option assigns <i>view-name</i> to the current camera
viewpoint (position and orientation). 
Subsequently, that viewpoint can be <a href="#note">restored</a>
over a specified number of image update <i>frames</i> (default <b>1</b> frame).
The <b>delete</b> option can be used to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; a specific
viewpoint or <b>all</b> viewpoints. 
The <b>list</b> option reports the names of all currently saved 
viewpoints in the <b>Log</b>, and clicking a name therein restores 
the corresponding viewpoint.

<h3>Transition between Camera Viewpoints</h3>
<p>
The camera is rotated with a linear change in angle
from its orientation in the first view to its orientation in the second view.
At the same time, the camera is translated so that
the center of rotation from the first view moves in a straight line
to the center of rotation in the second view.
