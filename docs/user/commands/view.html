The <b>view</b> command adjusts the view to make the
<a href="atomspec.html">specified</a> items fill the graphics window.
It also allows naming and later restoring the view, including the
positions of any models that have been moved separately.

The <b>view</b> command translates the scene, zooms in or out,
and places the <a href="clip.html">near/far clipping planes</a>
to bracket the displayed parts of the specified items.
If nothing is specified, all displayed items will be included
and near/far clipping deactivated.
The <b>orient</b> option additionally rotates the scene to a
standard orientation with X-axis horizontal increasing rightward,
Y-axis vertical increasing upward,
and Z-axis perpendicular to the screen increasing toward the viewer;
in other words, it aligns <a href="#scenecoords">scene coordinates</a> with
<a href="#screencoords">screen coordinates</a>.
The zoom level is adjusted to make the bounding box of the relevant items
abut the edges of the graphics window minus a <b>pad</b> <i>fraction</i> 
(allowed values &lt; 1.0, default <b>0.05</b> of the window width and height)
The desired <i>fraction</i> will usually be positive,
but negative values can be used to zoom in further.
The center of rotation is set to a fixed point at the 
center of the bounding box of the relevant items,
or if nothing is specified, allowed to vary according to the
<a href="cofr.html#method">front center method</a>.
</p><p>
The <b>name</b> option assigns <i>view-name</i> to the current view,
including the positions of any models that have been moved separately.
Subsequently, that view can be <a href="#note">restored</a>
over a specified number of image update <i>frames</i> (default <b>1</b> frame).
The <b>delete</b> option can be used to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; a specific
view or <b>all</b> views. 
The <b>list</b> option reports the names of all currently saved 
views in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>,
and clicking a name therein restores the corresponding view.

<h3>Transition between Views</h3>
<p>
Rotations and translations of the scene as a whole 
can be described as motions of the viewer or &ldquo;camera.&rdquo;
The camera is rotated with a linear change in angle
from its orientation in the first view to its orientation in the second view,
and simultaneously translated so that
the center of rotation in the first view moves in a straight line
in <a href="#screencoords">screen coordinates</a>
to the center of rotation in the second view.
At the same time, the positions of any models that have been moved
relative to the scene are interpolated between the two views.

<h3>Coordinate Systems</h3>
<p>
The <b><i>scene coordinate system</i></b> 
is subject to any global manipulations 
(rotations and translations of the scene as a whole)
and is the same as the coordinate system of a model
that has not been moved relative to other models.
</p><p>
The <b><i>screen coordinate system</i></b> has:
</p>
<ul>
<li>X-axis horizontal increasing rightward
<li>Y-axis vertical increasing upward
<li>Z-axis perpendicular to the screen increasing toward the viewer
</ul>
