<p>
The <b>contacts</b> command calculates the buried solvent-accessible
surface area (SASA) for each pair of chains in the
<a href="atomspec.html">specified</a> set of atoms, based on chain IDs,
and generates a <a href="#diagram">network diagram</a>
of the interchain contacts. Unspecified atoms are ignored, but
solvent, ions, and ligand residues are <i>not</i> excluded automatically.
The SASA is calculated as described
for <a href="buriedarea.html"><b>buriedarea</b></a>, and the measured 
interface areas are reported in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
See also: <a href="sasa.html"><b>sasa</b></a>
</p><p>
Whereas the <a href="surface.html"><b>surface</b></a> command shows
<b><i>solvent-excluded</i></b> surfaces (SES) defined by the closest
approach of the surface of a probe sphere rolled over the
atomic <a href="../radii.html">VDW spheres</a>,
the <b><i>solvent-accessible</i></b> surface (SAS) 
is traced out by the center of the probe sphere and is not displayed.
The <b>probeRadius</b> <i>rad</i> is the radius of this 
&ldquo;rolling sphere&rdquo; probe (default <b>1.4</b> &Aring;, 
the value often used to approximate a water molecule).
Interfaces with at least <i>area</i> buried
(default <b>300</b> &Aring;<sup>2</sup>) are counted as contacts
and shown as lines in the <a href="#diagram">diagram</a>.

In the 2D network diagram, the <b><i>nodes</i></b> (circles) represent chains,
and the <b><i>edges</i></b> (lines) between nodes 
represent chain-chain interfaces. 
Node colors match the predominant colors of the chains when the
diagram is created, and node sizes are proportional to chain surface areas.
Chain-chain interfaces with buried area 
less than half of the largest interface in the structure 
are depicted with dashed lines.
</p>
<!--
size of node?
solid vs dashed line?
clicking line shows atoms in that chain pair that were specified,
  hides atoms that were specified but not in that chain pair 
  (unspecified atoms remain displayed)

Notes
traceback and empty graph if no contacts, e.g. 5dwb "contact protein"
traceback and empty graph if I deleted parts of some chains, even if several 
  contacts are still found (e.g. 5dwb "delete /a:300-950; contact protein")
suggest areaCutoff -> cutoffArea like buriedArea command
suggest option to not generate diagram and/or to replace existing diagram
I get the same context menu no matter where I click in 2D diagram
"Unxplode" missing an "e"
explode/unexplode don't seem to work right on nucleic acids, e.g. 1bna, 5dwb
