<h3>Usage Conventions in Command Documentation</h3> 
<p>
In the <b>Usage</b> sections of command manual pages:
<ul>
<li> <b>keywords</b> to be taken literally are not italicized
<li> <b><i>parameters</i></b> that should be replaced with 
an appropriate value (such as a number or word) are italicized
<li><b><i>atom-spec</i></b> refers to an
<a href="atomspec.html">atom specification string</a>,
which generally specifies &ldquo;all&rdquo; when left blank
<li> optional keywords and parameters are referred to as
<b><i>options</i></b> or are enclosed in square brackets: <b>[&nbsp;]</b> 
<li> mutually exclusive choices are separated by a vertical bar: <b>|</b>
<li> mutually exclusive choices of a required item are grouped with
parentheses: <b>(&nbsp;)</b>
</ul>
The brackets, vertical bars, and parentheses mentioned above are 
merely symbolic and should not be included in the typed command.
</p><p>
Command names and keywords can be truncated to unique strings,
unless a command's manual page states otherwise.
</p><p>
Keyword options can be given in any order, except where 
dependencies are indicated with nested brackets.
</p><p>
The display is updated as needed when a user presses return after entering
a command, or when a <a href="wait.html"><b>wait</b></a>
command is executed within a script.
Multiple commands can be combined into a single line with semicolon separators.
During interactive command entry, this may be useful for making multi-frame 
actions start simultaneously or for suppressing the display
of intermediate states.
Semicolon separators are also needed for defining composite (multi-command)
actions with <b>alias</b> or <b>perframe</b>, whether interactively or in
a script.
