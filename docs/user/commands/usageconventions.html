<h3>Command Usage Conventions</h3> 
<p>
In the <b>Usage</b> sections of 
<a href="../index.html#commands">command manual pages</a>:
<ul>
<li> <b>keywords</b> to be taken literally are not italicized
<li> <b><i>parameters</i></b> that should be replaced with 
an appropriate value (such as a number or word) are italicized
<li><b><i>atom-spec</i></b> refers to an
<a href="atomspec.html">atom specification string</a>,
which generally specifies &ldquo;all&rdquo; when left blank
<li> optional keywords and parameters are referred to as
<b><i>options</i></b> or are enclosed in square brackets: <b>[&nbsp;]</b> 
<li> mutually exclusive choices are separated by a vertical bar: <b>|</b>
<li> mutually exclusive choices of a required item are grouped with
parentheses: <b>(&nbsp;)</b>
</ul>
The brackets, vertical bars, and parentheses mentioned above are 
merely symbolic and should not be included in the typed command.
</p><p>
Command names and keywords can be truncated to unique strings.
Command names should be entered as lowercase letters, whereas keywords can be
completely lowercase or capitalized as shown in the documentation,
typically camelCase for compound words.
</p><p>
Boolean (truth) values can also be truncated, with
synonyms for <b>true</b>: <b>True</b>, <b>1</b>, and
synonyms for <b>false</b>: <b>False</b>, <b>0</b>.
</p><p>
The display is updated as needed when a user presses return after entering
a command, or when a <a href="wait.html"><b>wait</b></a>
command is executed within a script.
Multiple commands can be combined into a single line with semicolon separators.
During interactive command entry, this may be useful for making multi-frame 
actions start simultaneously or for suppressing the display
of intermediate states.
Semicolon separators are also needed for defining composite (multi-command)
actions with <a href="alias.html"><b>alias</b></a>
or <b>perframe</b>, whether interactively or in a script.
</p><p>

<li><a href="colornames.html">color specification</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>ChimeraX Command Files</h3>
<p>
ChimeraX command files are plain text files 
containing the same commands that could be entered into the 
<a href="../tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line Interface</b></a>.
In addition, they may contain blank lines and/or comments
(text with # as the first nonspace character in a line, 
or in-line with # as the first nonspace character following a semicolon).
</p><p>
The filename suffix <b>.cxc</b> is recommended for ChimeraX command files.
