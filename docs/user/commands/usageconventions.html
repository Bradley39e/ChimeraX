<h3>Command Usage Conventions</h3>
<p>
<a href="../index.html#commands">Command help pages</a> have <b>Usage</b> lines 
that show syntax and options using various fonts and symbols:
<ul>
<li> <b>keywords</b> to be taken literally are not italicized
<li> <b><i>parameters</i></b> that should be replaced with 
an appropriate value (such as a number or word) are italicized
<li><b><i>atom-spec</i></b>, <b><i>model-spec</i></b>, <b><i>spec</i></b>,
and similar terms indicate <a href="atomspec.html">target specification</a>
strings, which generally mean &ldquo;all&rdquo; when left blank
<li> optional keywords and parameters are referred to as
<b><i>options</i></b> or are enclosed in square brackets: <b>[&nbsp;]</b> 
<li> mutually exclusive choices are separated by a vertical bar: <b>|</b>
<li> mutually exclusive choices of a required item are grouped with
parentheses: <b>(&nbsp;)</b>
</ul>
See also: <a href="help.html"><b>help</b></a>,
<a href="usage.html"><b>usage</b></a>,
<a href="colornames.html">color specification</a>
<p>
The brackets, vertical bars, and parentheses in the <b>Usage</b> lines are 
merely symbolic and should not be included in the typed command.
</p><p>
Command names and keywords can be truncated to unique strings,
with rare exceptions specifically noted.
Command names should be entered as lowercase letters, whereas keywords can be
completely lowercase or capitalized as shown in the documentation,
typically camelCase for compound words. 
If a truncation matches multiple keywords but one is a simpler compound
(for example, <b>silhouettes</b> rather than 
<b>silhouetteWidth</b> in the <a href="set.html"><b>set</b></a> command),
the simpler compound is used; otherwise, an ambiguity error is raised.
</p><p>
Boolean (truth) values can also be truncated, with
synonyms for <b>true</b>: <b>True</b>, <b>1</b>, and
synonyms for <b>false</b>: <b>False</b>, <b>0</b>.
</p><p>
<a name="browse"></a>
Substituting the word <b>browse</b> for a file or directory pathname brings up
a file browser window for specifying the name and location interactively.
Alternatively, dragging and dropping the icon for a file or directory into the
<a href="../tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line Interface</b></a>
substitutes the corresponding pathname text.
</p><p>
The display is updated as needed when a user presses return after entering
a command, or when a <a href="wait.html"><b>wait</b></a>
command is executed within a script.
Multiple commands can be combined into a single line with semicolon separators.
During interactive command entry, this may be useful for making multi-frame 
actions start simultaneously or for suppressing the display
of intermediate states.
Semicolon separators are also needed for defining composite (multi-command)
actions with <a href="alias.html"><b>alias</b></a>
or <a href="perframe.html"><b>perframe</b></a>,
whether interactively or in a script.

<h3>ChimeraX Command Files</h3>
<p>
ChimeraX command files are plain text files 
containing the same commands that could be entered into the 
<a href="../tools/cli.html"><b>Command Line Interface</b></a>.
In addition, they may contain blank lines and/or comments
(text with # as the first nonspace character in a line, 
or in-line with # as the first nonspace character following a semicolon).
The filename suffix <b>.cxc</b> is recommended.
</p><p>
Opening a ChimeraX command file in ChimeraX executes the commands.
