<p>
The <b>name</b> command defines a <i>target-name</i>
to be used as a synonym for <a href="atomspec.html"><i>spec</i></a>
in subsequent commands.  This can be used 
to replace a long <a href="atomspec.html">target specification</a>
string with something shorter and easier to type, 
or to name the current <a href="../selection.html">selection</a> 
for easy access 
to its contents later, regardless of what is selected at that time.
Subsequent occurrences of <i>target-name</i>
(space- and/or semicolon-delimited) in commands
are translated to the corresponding items.

<a href="rename.html"><b>rename</b></a>
</p><p>
A target can be defined as evaluate-now or evaluate-later:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An evaluate-later target created with <b>name</b> 
is simply expanded to the original 
<a href="atomspec.html"><i>spec</i></a> string when it is used.
<li>An evaluate-now target created with <b>name frozen</b>
is defined as only the currently evaluated contents of 
<a href="atomspec.html"><i>spec</i></a>,
which could be <b>sel</b> to indicate the
current <a href="../selection.html">selection</a>.
For example, if a selection of all oxygens in a specific atomic model
is defined as a target with:
<blockquote>
<b><a href="select.html">select</a> #2&O</b>
<br>
<b>name frozen proto sel</b>
</blockquote>
...the target <b>proto</b> will not be affected by any subsequent changes 
in what is selected, nor will it include the oxygens of any other 
atomic model, not even the same structure if it was closed and reopened 
as the same model number.
</ul>
<p>
<!-- nope as of Apr 9 2018
User-defined target definitions are saved in sessions.
-->
The command <b>name list</b> lists the names of all user-defined targets
in the <a href="../tools/log.html"><b>Log</b></a>.
The expansion of any evaluate-later target
can be shown with <b>name</b> <i>target-name</i>.
</p><p>
The command <b>name delete</b> can be used to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; a specific
user-defined target or <b>all</b> user-defined targets.
